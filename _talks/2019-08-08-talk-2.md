I presented at the BAIR Lab among the students who were doing summer research advised by Prof. Pieter Abbeel. The presentation was to introduce a paper called _Learning Deep Representations by mutual information estimation and maximization_ and share my understanding including the tuition, formalization, experiment validation and potential limitations.

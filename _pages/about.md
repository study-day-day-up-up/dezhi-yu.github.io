* I am currently an undergraduate student in [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/), pursuing Bachelor's Degree in Shool of Electronic Information and Electrical Engineering. 
* My research experience starts from sophomore year when I joined [APEX Lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/), in Computer Science Department and was advised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu).
* For the 2019 Spring Semester, I studied in UC Berkeley as an international exchange student and continued to do research in [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). 
* My research interest lies in Deep unsupervised learning, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. I am also highly interested in devising algorithms that enable the robots to solve complex tasks to help human make better decisions.
* My current CV is available [here](). If you are interested in my research or have any other questions, feel free to contact me!

* I received my B.E. in Information Security at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). In Fall 2021, I would start pursuing my M.S. in Computer Science at Stanford.
* My research interest lies in Deep unsupervised learning, Reinforcement Learning and Robotics. I am also highly interested in devising algorithms that enable the robots to solve complex tasks to help human make better decisions.
* My current CV is available [here](../files/cv.pdf). If you are interested in my research or have any other questions, feel free to contact me!

# Research Experience

* My research experience starts from sophomore year when I joined [APEX Lab](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/), in Computer Science Department and was advised by [Prof. Weinan Zhang](http://wnzhang.net/) and [Prof. Yong Yu](http://apex.sjtu.edu.cn/members/yyu).
* For the 2019 Spring Semester, I studied in [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) as an international exchange student and continued to do research in [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/). 


# Recent News

* July. 2020. Our paper [*Learning to Manipulate Deformable Objects without Demonstrations*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13439) is accepted by the 2020 [RSS](https://roboticsconference.org/) conference.
* May. 2019. I start my summer research intership at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) [BAIR Lab](https://bair.berkeley.edu/), advised by [Prof. Pieter Abbeel](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~pabbeel/), mentored by [Thanard Kurutach](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~thanard.kurutach/) and [Lerrel Pinto](https://cs.nyu.edu/~lp91/).
